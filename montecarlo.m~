% Inputs
    % s0: initial relay location, 1 by 2 matrix
    % nmbrSensors: number of sensors, scalor
    % sensorLocations: sensor locations, m by 2 matrix
% Outputs
    % smin: optimal relay location, 1 by 2 matrix
    % fmin: optimal objective value, scalor
    % k: number of iterations
% version history:
    % OR, Created for MAST30013 Project, 2021/05/16
%% Monte carlo simulation, 
% this will be the baseline for the project, essentially we guess a whole
% bunch of relay locations and pick the best one. I guess iterations = k
function [smin, fmin, k] = montecarlo(s0, nmbrSensors, sensorLocations)
